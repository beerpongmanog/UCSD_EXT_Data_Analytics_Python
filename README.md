# UCSD_EXT_Data_Analytics_Python
Legally allowable public portion of the UCSD Extension course: [Data Analytics Using Python (CSE-41204)](https://extension.ucsd.edu/courses-and-programs/data-analytics-using-python). 

## Key Topics
* Installing Python/Jupyter/IPython on Windows and Mac
* Python Basics (variables, strings, simple math, conditional logic, for loops, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.)
* Using the Pandas library to manipulate data (filtering and sorting data, combining files, GroupBy, etc.)
* Plotting data in Python using Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Logistic Regression using Scikit-Learn
* Classification and Regression Metrics
* Decision Trees using Scikit-Learn
* Random Forests (Scikit-Learn)
* Clustering Algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)
* Dimensionality Reduction (Principal Component Analysis)

## Practical Experience 
* Hands on programming assignments that are reviewed weekly via screen sharing videos
* The primary assignment for this class is a project of a studentâ€™s choice.

## Course Typically Offered
Online in Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer.

## Software
Students will use Python 3.x/Jupyter/IPython to complete hands-on assignments (if for some reason you insist of using Python 2.x, that is fine too). All These tools are free and open-source.

## Prerequisites
None. General programming knowledge is helpful.
